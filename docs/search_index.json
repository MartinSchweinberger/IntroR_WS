If you have no or little experience with this, you can prepare and refresh what we have done in these tutorials: Getting started with R Handling tables in R Before attending the workshop, you need to install the following packages in RStudio: here (for easy pathing) ggplot2 (for general data visualization) dplyr (for data processing) stringr (also for data processing) umap (for UMAP) tsne (for t-SNE) knitr (for knitting R Notebooks) markdown (for rendering Rmd files) rmarkdown (for R Markdown formatting) installr (for updating R) You can update R and install these packages by clicking on packages on the top of the lower right pane in RStudio or you can execute the following code in the lower left, Console pane of RStudio. # update R #install.packages(&quot;installr&quot;) #library(installr) #updateR() # install required packages install.packages(c(&quot;here&quot;, &quot;readxl&quot;, &quot;dplyr&quot;, &quot;stringr&quot;, &quot;umap&quot;, &quot;tsne&quot;, &quot;ggplot2&quot;, &quot;knitr&quot;, &quot;markdown&quot;, &quot;rmarkdown&quot;, &quot;devtools&quot;), dependencies = T) It is really important that you have knowledge of R and RStudio and that you have installed the packages before the workshop so that we do not have to deal with technical issues too much. You can follow this workshop in different ways - you can sit back and watch it like a lecture or take a more active role - that said, the intention for this workshop is clearly to be practical so that I show something and then you do it on you computer and we have exercises where you can try out what you have just learned. Choose which option suits you best and then go with it. 1.2 Timeline Here is what we have planned to cover in this workshop: Wednesday, 12 June, 10 am - 4 pm (lunch: 11:45am - 12:30 pm, coffee: 2 - 2:30pm) Introduction Session preparation Getting started with R Basics of data processing with R (regular expressions, working with tables and text) Thursday, 13 June, 10 am - 4 pm (lunch: 11:45am - 12:30 pm, coffee: 2 - 2:30pm) Introduction to Text Analytics with R Concordancing Collocation Analysis Keyword Analysis Network Analysis Text Classification Annotation (pos-tagging, NER, parsing) Wrap-up 1.3 Getting started For everything to work, please do the following: GitHub Check your GitHub log in details or create a new GitHub account Folder set up Create a folder for this workshop somewhere on your computer, e.g.Â called IntroR_WS In that folder, create two subfolders called data and images Open RStudio, go to File &gt; New Project &gt; Existing Directory (Browse to project folder) &gt; Create (and hit Enter) This will then create an R Project in the project folder. Data and files Save the data set that I sent round (SPR_trimmed_Martin.xlsx) in the subfolder called data and save the rmd2jupyter.Rmd file on the main level.
