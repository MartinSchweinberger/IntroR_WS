# Introduction to R

> **UNFINISHED! WORK IN PROGRESS! I'M STILL WORKING ON THE CONTENT**

Here I want to show you how to get started with R. As such, this section is aimed at fresh users or beginners with the aim of showcasing how to set up a R session in RStudio, how to set up R projects, and how to do basic operations using R such as loading and manipulation tabular data and generating basic visualization using R. 


[Here](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) is an overview of cheat sheets for popular and frequently used packages provided by RStudio (cheat sheets are short overviews with explanations and examples of useful functions). If you already have experience with R, both @wickham2016r (see [here](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)) and  @gillespie2016efficient (see [here](https://bookdown.org/csgillespie/efficientR/)) are highly recommendable and excellent resources for improving your coding abilities and workflows in R.

## Preparation

Before you actually open R or RStudio, there things to consider that make working in R much easier and give your workflow a better structure. 

Imagine it like this: when you want to write a book, you could simply take pen and paper and start writing *or* you could think about what you want to write about, what different chapters your book would consist of, which chapters to write first, what these chapters will deal with, etc. The same is true for R: you could simply open R and start writing code *or* you can prepare you session and structure what you will be doing.

### Before you start working with R/RStudio (Folder Structure and R projects)

Before actually starting with writing code, you should prepare the session by going through the following steps:

#### 1. Create a folder for your project

In that folder, create the following sub-folders (you can, of course, adapt this folder template to match your needs)

  - data (you do not create this folder for the present workshop as you can simply use the data folder that you downloaded for this workshop instead)
  - images
  - tables
  - docs

The folder for your project could look like the the one shown below.

```{r rstudio01, echo=F, fig.cap="", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://slcladal.github.io/images/RStudio_newfolder.png")
```   

Once you have created your project folder, you can go ahead with RStudio.

#### 2. Open RStudio

This is what RStudio looks like when you first open it: 

```{r , echo=F, fig.cap="", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://slcladal.github.io/images/RStudio_empty.png")
``` 

In RStudio, click on `File` 
  
```{r rstudio02, echo=F, fig.cap="", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://slcladal.github.io/images/RStudio_file.png")
``` 

You can use the drop-down menu to create a `R project`

#### 3. R Projects

In RStudio, click on `New Project`
  
```{r rstudio05, echo=F, fig.cap="", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://slcladal.github.io/images/RStudio_newfile.png")
``` 
  
Next, confirm by clicking `OK` and select `Existing Directory`.

Then, navigate to where you have just created the project folder for this workshop.
  
```{r rstudio06, echo=F, fig.cap="", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width='30%'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://slcladal.github.io/images/RStudio_existingdirectory.png")
```  
  
Once you click on `Open`, you have created a new `R project` 
  
#### 4. R Notebooks
  
In this project, click on `File`
  
```{r rstudio10, echo=F, fig.cap="", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://slcladal.github.io/images/RStudio_file.png")
``` 
  
Click on `New File` and then on `R Notebook` as shown below.

```{r rstudio12, echo=F, fig.cap="", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://slcladal.github.io/images/RStudio_newnotebook.png")
```  

This `R Notebook` will be the file in which you do all your work.



#### 5. Updating R

In case you encounter issues when opening the R Notebook (e.g., if you receive an error message saying that you need to update packages which then do not install properly), you may have to *update your R version*.

To update your current R version to the recent release please copy the code chunk shown below into the console pane (the bottom left pane) and click on `Enter` to run the code. The code will automatically update your version of R to the most recent release. During the update, you may be asked to specify some options - in that case, you can simply click on *Accept* and *Next* and accept the default settings.

```{r updater, eval=F, warning=F, message=F}
# install installr package
install.packages("installr")
# load installr package
library(installr)
# update r
updateR()
```

#### 6. Optimizing R project options

When you work with projects, it is recommendable to control the so-called *environment*. This means that you make your R Project self-contained by storing all packages that are used in project in a library *in the R Project* (instead of in the general R library on your computer). Having a library in your R Project means that you can share your project folder wit other people and they will automatically have the same package versions that you have sued which makes your code more robust and reproducible.

So, how to create such an environment? You simply click on `Tools` (at the very top right of RStudio), then click on`Project Options` then click on `Environments` and then check `Use renv with this project`. Now, when you install packages, they will be installed in the package library (rather than the general R library on your computer).


#### 7. Getting started with R Notebooks

You can now start writing in this R Notebook. For instance, you could start by changing the title of the R Notebook and describe what you are doing (what this Notebook contains).

Below is a picture of what this document looked like when I started writing it.

```{r , echo=F, fig.cap="", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://slcladal.github.io/images/RStudio_editMD.png")
```  

When you write in the R Notebook, you use what is called `R Markdown` which is explained below.


#### R Markdown

The Notebook is an [R Markdown document](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/): a Rmd (R Markdown) file is more than a flat text document: it's a program that you can run in R and which allows you to combine prose and code, so readers can see the technical aspects of your work while reading about their interpretive significance. 

You can get a nice and short overview of the formatting options in R Markdown (Rmd) files [here](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf).


R Markdown allows you to make your research fully transparent and reproducible! If a couple of years down the line another researcher or a journal editor asked you how you have done your analysis, you can simply send them the Notebook or even the entire R-project folder. 

As such, Rmd files are a type of document that allows to 

+ include snippets of code (and any outputs such as tables or graphs) in plain text while 

+ encoding the *structure* of your document by using simple typographical symbols to encode formatting (rather than HTML tags or format types such as *Main header* or *Header level 1* in Word).  

Markdown is really quite simple to learn and these resources may help:

+ The [Markdown Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) includes a very handy chart of the syntax.

+ John Gruber developed Markdown and his [introduction to the syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) is worth browsing.

+ This [interactive Markdown tutorial](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/) will teach you the syntax in a few minutes.

## R and RStudio Basics

RStudio is a so-called IDE - Integrated Development Environment. The interface provides easy access to R. The advantage of this application is that R programs and files as well as a project directory can be managed easily. The environment is capable of editing and running program code, viewing outputs and rendering graphics. Furthermore, it is possible to view variables and data objects of an R-script directly in the interface. 

### RStudio: Panes

The GUI - Graphical User Interface - that RStudio provides divides the screen into four areas that are called **panes**:

1. File editor
2. Environment variables
3. R console
4. Management panes (File browser, plots, help display and R packages).

The two most important are the R console (bottom left) and the File editor (or Script in the top left).
The Environment variables and Management panes are on the right of the screen and they contain: 

* **Environment** (top): Lists all currently defined objects and data sets
* **History** (top): Lists all commands recently used or associated with a project
* **Plots** (bottom): Graphical output goes here
* **Help** (bottom): Find help for R packages and functions.  Don't forget you can type `?` before a function name in the console to get info in the Help section. 
* **Files** (bottom): Shows the files available to you in your working directory

These RStudio panes are shown below.

```{r intro_01_17, fig.width=10, fig.height=8, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://slcladal.github.io/images/RStudioscreenshot.png")
```

#### R Console (bottom left pane)

The console pane allows you to quickly and immediately execute R code. You can experiment with functions here, or quickly print data for viewing. 

Type next to the `>` and press `Enter` to execute. 

***

<div class="warning" style='padding:0.1em; background-color:#51247a; color:#f2f2f2'>
<span>
<p style='margin-top:1em; text-align:center'>
<b>EXERCISE TIME!</b></p>
<p style='margin-left:1em;'>
</p></span>
</div>

<div class="question">` 

1. You can use R like a calculator.  Try typing `2+8` into the **R console**.

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  ```{r calculator}
  2+8
  ```
  
</details>

</div>`

***

Here, the plus sign is the **operator**.  Operators are symbols that represent some sort of action.  However, R is, of course, much more than a simple calculator.  To use R more fully, we need to understand **objects**, **functions**, and **indexing** - which we will learn about as we go.

For now, think of *objects as nouns* and *functions as verbs*. 

#### Running commands from a script

To run code from a script, insert your cursor on a line with a command, and press `CTRL/CMD+Enter`.

Or highlight some code to only run certain sections of the command, then press `CTRL/CMD+Enter` to run.

Alternatively, use the `Run` button at the top of the pane to execute the current line or selection (see below).

```{r rstudio13, echo=F, fig.cap="", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://slcladal.github.io/images/RStudio_run.png")
```  

#### Script Editor (top left pane)

In contrast to the R console, which quickly runs code, the Script Editor (in the top left) does not automatically execute code. The Script Editor allows you to save the code essential to your analysis.  You can re-use that code in the moment, refer back to it later, or publish it for replication.  


Now, that we have explored RStudio, we are ready to get started with R!

## Getting started with R

This section introduces some basic concepts and procedures that help optimize your workflow in R. 

### Setting up an R session

At the beginning of a session, it is common practice to define some basic parameters. This is not required or even necessary, but it may just help further down the line. This session preparation may include specifying options. In the present case, we 

+ want R to show numbers as numbers up to 100 decimal points (and not show them in mathematical notation (in mathematical notation, 0.007 would be represented as 0.7e^-3^))

+ want R to show maximally 100 results (otherwise, it can happen that R prints out pages-after-pages of some numbers).

Again, the session preparation is not required or necessary but it can help avoid errors. 

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
# set options
options(stringsAsFactors = F)                           
options(scipen = 100) 
options(max.print=100) 
```

In script editor pane of RStudio, this would look like this:

```{r , echo=F, fig.cap="", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://slcladal.github.io/images/RStudio_preparation.png")
``` 

### Packages

When using R, most of the functions are not loaded or even installing automatically. Instead, most functions are in contained in what are called **packages**. 

R comes with about 30 packages ("base R").  There are over 10,000 user-contributed packages; you can discover these packages online.  A prevalent collection of packages is the Tidyverse, which includes ggplot2, a package for making graphics. 

Before being able to use a package, we need to install the package (using the `install.packages` function) and load the package (using the `library` function). However, a package only needs to be installed once(!) and can then simply be loaded. When you install a package, this will likely install several other packages it depends on.  You should have already installed tidyverse before the workshop. 

You must load the package in any new R session where you want to use that package.    Below I show what you need to type when you want to install the `tidyverse`, the `tidytext`,  the `quanteda`, the `readxl`, and the `tm` packages (which are the packages that we will need in this workshop).

```{r, echo=T, eval=F, message=F, warning=F}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("tidytext")
install.packages("quanteda")
install.packages("readxl")
install.packages("tm")
install.packages("tokenizers")
install.packages("here")
install.packages("flextable")
# install klippy for copy-to-clipboard button in code chunks
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("rlesur/klippy")
```

To load these packages, use the `library` function which takes the package name as its main argument.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytext)
library(quanteda)
library(readxl)
library(tm)
library(tokenizers)
library(here)
library(flextable)
# activate klippy for copy-to-clipboard button
klippy::klippy()
```

The session preparation section of your Rmd file will thus also state which packages a script relies on.

In script editor pane of RStudio, the code blocks that install and activate packages would look like this:

```{r echo=F, fig.cap="", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://slcladal.github.io/images/RStudio_packages.png")
``` 

### Getting help

When working with R, you will encounter issues and face challenges. A very good thing about R is that it provides various ways to get help or find information about the issues you face.

#### Finding help within R

To get help regrading what functions a package contains, which arguments a function takes or to get information about how to use a function, you can use the `help` function or the `apropos`. function or you can simply type a `?` before the package or two `??` if this does not give you any answers. 

```{r intro_01_11, echo=TRUE, eval=F, warning=F, message=F}
help(tidyverse) 
apropos("tidyverse")
?require
```

There are also other "official" help resources from R/RStudio. 

* Read official package documentation, see vignettes, e.g., Tidyverse <https://cran.r-project.org/package=tidyverse>

* Use the RStudio Cheat Sheets at <https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/>

* Use the RStudio Help viewer by typing `?` before a function or package

* Check out the keyboard shortcuts `Help` under `Tools` in RStudio for some good tips 

#### Finding help online

One great thing about R is that you can very often find an answer to your question online.

* Google your error! See <http://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html#getting-help-and-learning-more> for excellent suggestions on how to find help for a specific question online.

## Working with text

In this section, we will learn how to work with textual data in R and we use positive IMDB reviews as our example texts. Before we start, it is important to understand the general logic of R code which is why we start with a very brief explanation of functions and objects.

### Functions and Objects

In R, functions always have the following form: `function(argument1, argument2, ..., argumentN)`. Typically a function does something to an object (e.g. a table), so that the first argument typically specifies the data to which the function is applied. Other arguments then allow to add some information. Just as a side note, functions are also objects that do not contain data but instructions.

To assign content to an object, we use `<-` or `=` so that the we provide a name for an object, and then assign some content to it. For example, `MyObject <- 1:3` means *Create an object called `MyObject`. this object should contain the numbers 1 to 3*.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# generate an object
MyObject <- 1:3
# inspecting my object
MyObject
# inspect structure of my object
str(MyObject)
```

### Inspecting data

There are many ways to inspect data. We will briefly go over the most common ways to inspect data.

The `head` function takes the data-object as its first argument and automatically shows the first 6 elements of an object (or rows if the data-object has a table format).

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
head(icebio)
```

But first, we will learn how to load texts into R.

### Loading text data

There are many functions that we can use to load text data into R. For example, we can use the `readLines` function as shown below.


```{r, echo=T, eval=T, message=F, warning=F}
text <- readLines(here::here("data", "reviews_pos/textpos1.txt"))
# inspect first text element
text
```

To load many texts, we can use a loop to read all texts in a folder as shown below. In a first step, we define the paths of the texts and then, we use the `map_chr` function from the `purrr` package to loop over the paths and read them into R. In addition, we add names to the texts based on the paths from where the texts were loaded.


```{r load_texts_tidy, eval=T, echo=T, message=F, warning=F}
# define paths
reviews_pos <- list.files(here::here("data/reviews_pos"), full.names = T, pattern = ".*txt") %>%
  # load data
  purrr::map_chr(~ readr::read_file(.))
# add names
names(reviews_pos) <- list.files(here::here("data/reviews_pos"), pattern = ".*txt") %>%
  stringr::str_remove_all(".txt")
# inspect first text element
reviews_pos[1]
```


### Saving text data


To save many text files on your computer, you need to first define the locations where you want to save the texts and then, in a second step, you save the files (as shown below).

> IMPORTANT: I have created a folder called `output` in my data folder in which the texts will be saved!


```{r}
# define where to save each file
outs <- file.path(paste0(here::here(), "/", "data/output", "/", names(reviews_pos), ".txt", sep = ""))
head(outs)
```




> IMPORTANT: I have set the chunk attribute eval to F (FALSE) so that this chunk is npot executed automatically. To run the code chunk, please just click the green "play button" in the top right corner of the code chunk.

```{r eval = F}
# save the files
lapply(seq_along(reviews_pos), function(i) 
       writeLines(reviews_pos[[i]],  
       con = outs[i]))
```

### Piping 

Piping is done using the `%>%` sequence and it can be translated as **and then**. In the example below, we take the existing object (text) *and then* we convert it to upper case  **and then** we store the result in a new object (text2).

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
text %>%
  toupper() -> text2
# inspect data
text2
```

### Extracting frequency information from text

Frequency lists are very basic but also important when analysing text. Fortunately, it is very easy to extract frequency information and to create frequency lists with R. We can do this by first using the `unnest_tokens`  function which splits texts into individual words, an then use the `count` function to get the raw frequencies of all word types in a text.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
reviews_pos %>%
  # convert to data frame
  as.data.frame()%>%
  # give name column with text
  dplyr::rename(text = 1) %>%
  # tokenise
  tidytext::unnest_tokens(word, text) %>%
  # count tokens
  dplyr::count(word, sort=T)
```

Extracting N-grams is also very easy as the `unnest_tokens`  function can an argument called `token` in which we can specify that we want to extract n-grams, If we do this, then we need to specify the `n` as a separate argument. Below we specify that we want the frequencies of all 4-grams.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
reviews_pos %>%
    # convert to data frame
  as.data.frame()%>%
  # give name column with text
  dplyr::rename(text = 1) %>%
  # clean data
  dplyr::mutate(text = str_remove_all(text, "<.*?>")) %>%
  # tokenise and extract trigrams
  tidytext:: unnest_tokens(word, text, token="ngrams", n=3) %>%
  # count tokens
  dplyr::count(word, sort=T) %>%
  # inspect ten most frequent tri-grams
  head(10)
```

### Regular Expressions

In  this section, we focus on regular expressions (to learn more about regular expression, have a look at this very recommendable  [tutorial](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/articles/regular-expressions.html)). Regular expressions are powerful tools used to search and manipulate text patterns. They provide a way to find specific sequences of characters within larger bodies of text. 

There are two basic types of regular expressions:

* regular expressions that stand for  frequencies (quantifiers)

* regular expressions that stand for classes of symbols (types)

The regular expressions below show the first type of regular expressions, i.e. quantifiers.

```{r regex1, echo=F, fig.cap="", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width='95%'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://slcladal.github.io/images/regex_tb1.png")
```  



The regular expressions below show the second type of regular expressions, i.e. types.

```{r regex2, echo=F, fig.cap="", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width='95%'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://slcladal.github.io/images/regex_tb2.png")
```  

Types can be expanded to include structural properties as shown below.

```{r regex3, echo=F, fig.cap="", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width='95%'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://slcladal.github.io/images/regex_tb3.png")
``` 

To practice working with regular expressions, we will focus on only the very first positive IMDB movie review and also create a tokenised version of this review:

```{r}
review <- reviews_pos[4]
review_tok <- quanteda::tokens(review) %>% unlist() %>% as.vector()
# inspect
review; str(review_tok)
```

We now want to show all words in the tokenized review that contain `y`.

```{r regex10, echo=T, eval = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
review_tok[str_detect(review_tok, "[y]")]
```

Show all words in the split tokenized review  that begin with a lower case `a`.

```{r regex11, echo=T, eval = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
review_tok[str_detect(review_tok, "^a")]
```

Show all words in the split tokenized review  that end in a lower case `s`.

```{r regex12, echo=T, eval = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
review_tok[str_detect(review_tok, "s$")]
```

Show all words in the split tokenized review  in which there is an `e`, then any other character, and than another `n`.

```{r regex13, echo=T, eval = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
review_tok[str_detect(review_tok, "e.n")]
```

Show all words in the tokenized review  text in which there is an `e`, then two other characters, and than another `n`.

```{r regex14, echo=T, eval = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
review_tok[str_detect(review_tok, "e.{2,2}n")]
```

Show all words that consist of exactly three alphabetical characters in the tokenized review .

```{r regex15, echo=T, eval = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
review_tok[str_detect(review_tok, "^[:alpha:]{3,3}$")]
```

Show all words that consist of six or more alphabetical characters in the tokenized review.

```{r regex16, echo=T, eval = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
review_tok[str_detect(review_tok, "^[:alpha:]{6,}$")]
```

Replace all lower case `a`s with upper case `E`s in the review.

```{r regex17, echo=T, eval = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
str_replace_all(review, "a", "E")
```

Remove all non-alphabetical characters in the tokenized review.

```{r regex18, echo=T, eval = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
str_remove_all(review_tok, "\\W")
```

Remove all white spaces in the  review.

```{r regex19, echo=T, eval = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
str_remove_all(review, " ")
```


### Splitting-up texts

We can use the `str_split` function to split texts. However, there are two issues when using this (very useful) function:

  + the pattern that we want to split on disappears 

  + the output is a list (a special type of data format)

To remedy these issues, we 

  + combine the `str_split` function with the `unlist` function 

  + add something right at the beginning of the pattern that we use to split the text. 
To add something to the beginning of the pattern that we want to split the text by, we use the `str_replace_all` function. The `str_replace_all` function takes three arguments, 1. the **text**, 2. the **pattern** that should be replaced, 3. the **replacement**. In the example below, we add `~~~` to the sequence `movie` and then split on the `~~~` rather than on the sequence "movie" (in other words, we replace `movie` with `~~~movie` and then split on `~~~`).

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
reviews_pos_split <- unlist(str_split(
  stringr::str_replace_all(reviews_pos, "movie", "~~~movie"),
  pattern = "~~~"))
# inspect data
nchar(reviews_pos_split); str(reviews_pos_split)
```


### Basic String Processing

Before turning to more advanced string processing (in the context of computation, texts are referred to as strings) using the `stringr` package, let us just  focus on some basic functions that are extremely useful when working with texts.

A very useful function is, e.g. `tolower` which converts everything to lower case. 

```{r lwr, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
tolower(reviews_pos[4])
```

Conversely, `toupper` converts everything to upper case. 

```{r upr, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
toupper(reviews_pos[4])
```


The `stringr` package (see [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/strings.pdf) is part of the so-called *tidyverse* - a collection of packages that allows to write R code in a readable manner - and it is the most widely used package for string processing in . The advantage of using `stringr` is that it makes string processing very easy. All `stringr` functions share a common structure:

`str_function(string, pattern)`

The two arguments in the structure of `stringr` functions are:  *string* which is the character string to be processed and a pattern which is either a simple sequence of characters, a regular expression, or a combination of both. Because the *string* comes first, the `stringr` functions are ideal for piping and thus use in tidyverse style R. 

All function names of `stringr` begin with str, then an underscore and then the name of the action to be performed.  For example, to replace the first occurrence of a pattern in a string, we should use `str_replace()`. In the following, we will use `stringr` functions to perform various operations on the example text. As we have already loaded the `tidyverse` package, we can start right away with using `stringr` functions as shown below.

Like `nchar` in `base`, `str_count` provides the number of characters of a text.

```{r stringr2, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
str_count(reviews_pos[1:5])
```

The function `str_detect` informs about whether a pattern is present in a text and outputs a logical vector with *TRUE* if the pattern occurs and *FALSE* if it does not.

```{r stringr3, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
str_detect(reviews_pos[4], "and")
```	

The function `str_extract` extracts the first occurrence of a pattern, if that pattern is present in a text.

```{r stringr4, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
str_extract(reviews_pos[4], "and")
```	

The function `str_extract_all` extracts all occurrences of a pattern, if that pattern is present in a text.

```{r stringr5, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
str_extract_all(reviews_pos[4], "and")
```	

The function `str_locate` provides the start and end position of the match of the pattern in a text.

```{r stringr6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

str_locate(reviews_pos[4], "and") 
```

The function `str_locate_all` provides the start and end positions of the match of the pattern in a text and displays the result in matrix-form.

```{r stringr7, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
str_locate_all(reviews_pos[4], "and")
```

The function `str_match` extracts the first occurrence of the pattern in a text.


```{r stringr8, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
str_match(reviews_pos[4], "and") 

```

The function `str_match_all` extracts the all occurrences of the pattern from a text.

```{r stringr9, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
str_match_all(reviews_pos[4], "and")
```

The function `str_remove` removes the first occurrence of a pattern in a text.

```{r stringr10, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
str_remove(reviews_pos[4], "and") 
```

The function `str_remove_all` removes all occurrences of a pattern from a text.

```{r stringr11, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
str_remove_all(reviews_pos[4], "and")
```

The function `str_replace` replaces the first occurrence of a pattern with something else in a text.

```{r stringr12, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
str_replace(reviews_pos[4], "and", "AND")
```

The function `str_replace_all` replaces all occurrences of a pattern with something else in a text.

```{r stringr13, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
str_replace_all(reviews_pos[4], "and", "AND")
```

The function `str_starts` tests whether a given text begins with a certain pattern and outputs a logical vector.

```{r stringr14, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
str_starts(reviews_pos[4], "and") 
```

The function `str_ends` tests whether a text ends with a certain pattern and outputs a logical vector.

```{r stringr15, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
str_ends(reviews_pos[4], "and")
```

Like `strsplit`, the function `str_split` splits a text when a given pattern occurs. If no pattern is provided, then the text is split into individual symbols.

```{r stringr16, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
str_split(reviews_pos[4], "and") 
```

The function `str_split_fixed` splits a text when a given pattern occurs but only so often as is indicated by the argument `n`. So, even if the patter occur more often than `n`, `str_split_fixed` will only split the text `n` times.

```{r stringr17, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
str_split_fixed(reviews_pos[4], "and", n = 3)
```

The function `str_subset` extracts those subsets of a text that contain a certain pattern.  

```{r stringr18, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
str_subset(review_tok, "and") 
```

The function `str_which` provides a vector with the indices of the texts that contain a certain pattern. 

```{r stringr19, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
str_which(review_tok, "and")
```

The function `str_view` shows the locations of the first instances of a pattern in a text or vector of texts.


```{r stringr20, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
str_view(reviews_pos[4], "and")
```

The function `str_view_all` shows the locations of all instances of a pattern in a text or vector of texts.

```{r stringr21, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
str_view_all(reviews_pos[4], "and")
```

The function `str_pad` adds white spaces to a text or vector of texts so that they reach a given number of symbols.

```{r stringr22, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# create text with white spaces
text <- " this    is a    text   "
str_pad(text, width = 30)
```

The function `str_trim` removes white spaces from the beginning(s) and end(s) of a text or vector of texts.

```{r stringr23, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
str_trim(text) 
```

The function `str_squish` removes white spaces that occur within a text or vector of texts.

```{r stringr24, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
str_squish(text)
```

The function `str_wrap` removes white spaces  from the beginning(s) and end(s) of a text or vector of texts and also those white spaces that occur within a text or vector of texts.

```{r stringr25, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
str_wrap(text)
```

The function `str_order` provides a vector that represents the order of a vector of texts according to the lengths of texts in that vector.

```{r stringr26, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
str_order(reviews_pos_split)
```

The function `str_sort` orders of a vector of texts according to the lengths of texts in that vector.

```{r stringr27, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
str_sort(reviews_pos_split) %>%
  head()
```

The function `str_to_upper` converts all symbols in a text or vector of texts to upper case.

```{r stringr28, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
str_to_upper(reviews_pos[4]) 
```

The function `str_to_lower` converts all symbols in a text or vector of texts to lower case.

```{r stringr29, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
str_to_lower(reviews_pos[4]) 
```

The function `str_c` combines texts into one text

```{r stringr30, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
str_c(reviews_pos[4], reviews_pos[7])
```

The function `str_conv` converts a text into a certain type of encoding, e.g. into `UTF-8` or `Latin1`.

```{r stringr31, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
str_conv(reviews_pos[4], encoding = "UTF-8")
```

The function `str_dup` reduplicates a text or a vector of texts n times.

```{r stringr32, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
str_dup(reviews_pos[4], times=2)
```

The function `str_flatten` combines a vector of texts into one text. The argument `collapse` defines the symbol that occurs between the combined texts. If the argument `collapse` is left out, the texts will be combined without any symbol between the combined texts.


```{r stringr33, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
str_flatten(c(reviews_pos[4], reviews_pos[7]), collapse = " ")
```

 If the argument `collapse` is left out, the texts will be combined without any symbol between the combined texts.

```{r stringr34, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
str_flatten(c(reviews_pos[4], reviews_pos[7]))
```

The function `str_length` provides the length of texts in characters.

```{r stringr35, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
str_length(reviews_pos[4])
```

The function `str_replace_na` replaces NA in texts. It is important to note that NA, if it occurs within a string, is considered to be the literal string `NA`.

```{r stringr36, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# create sentences with NA
sentencesna <- c("Some text", NA, "Some more text", "Some NA text")
# apply str_replace_na function
str_replace_na(sentencesna, replacement = "Something new")
```

The function `str_trunc` ends strings with ... after a certain number of characters.

```{r stringr37, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
str_trunc(reviews_pos[4], width = 20)
```

The function `str_sub` extracts a string from a text from a start location to an end position (expressed as character positions).

```{r stringr38, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
str_sub(reviews_pos[4], 5, 25)
```

The function `word` extracts words from a text (expressed as word positions).


```{r stringr39, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
word(reviews_pos[4], 2:7)
```


The function `str_glue` combines strings and allows to input variables.

```{r stringr40, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
name <- "Fred"
age <- 50
anniversary <- as.Date("1991-10-12")
str_glue(
  "My name is {name}, ",
  "my age next year is {age + 1}, ",
  "and my anniversary is {format(anniversary, '%A, %B %d, %Y')}."
)
```


### Advanced String Processing {-}

Above, we have used functions and regular expressions to extract and find patters in textual data. Here, we will focus on common methods for cleaning text data that are applied before implementing certain methods.

We start by installing and then loading some additional packages, e.g., the `quanteda` (see [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/quanteda.pdf) for a cheat sheet for the `quanteda` package), the `tm`, and the `udpipe` package, which are extremely useful when dealing with more advanced text processing.


```{r atp0, eval = F, message=F, warning=F}
install.packages("quanteda")
install.packages("tm")
install.packages("udpipe")
```


```{r atp1, message=F, warning=F}
library(quanteda)
library(tm)
library(udpipe) 
```

One common procedure is to split texts into sentences which we can do by using, e.g., the  `tokenize_sentence` function from the `quanteda` package. I also unlist the data to have a vector wot work with (rather than a list).


```{r atp3, message=F, warning=F}
et_sent <- quanteda::tokenize_sentence(reviews_pos[4]) %>%
  unlist()
# inspect
et_sent
```

Another common procedure is to remove stop words, i.e., words that do not have semantic or referential meaning (like nouns such as *tree* or *cat*, or verbs like *sit* or *speak* or adjectives such as *green* or *loud*) but that indicate syntactic relations, roles, or features.(e.g., articles and pronouns). We can remove stopwords using, e.g., the  `removeWords` function from the `tm` package


```{r atp5, message=F, warning=F}
et_wostop <-  tm::removeWords(reviews_pos[4], tm::stopwords("english"))
# inspect
et_wostop
```

To remove the superfluous whote spaces, we can use, e.g., the  `stripWhitespace` function from the `tm` package.

```{r atp6, message=F, warning=F}
et_wows <-  tm::stripWhitespace(et_wostop)
# inspect
et_wows
```

It can also be useful to remove numbers. We can do this using, e.g., the  `removeNumbers` function from the `tm` package.


```{r atp7, message=F, warning=F}
et_wonum <-  tm::removeNumbers("This is the 1 and only sentence I will write in 2022.")
# inspect
et_wonum
```

We may also want to remove any type of punctuation using, e.g., the  `removePunctuation` function from the `tm` package.



```{r atp9, message=F, warning=F}
et_wopunct <-  tm::removePunctuation(reviews_pos[4])
# inspect
et_wopunct
```

We may also want to stem the words in a  document, i.e. removing the ends of words to be able to group together semantically related words such as *walk*, *walks*, *walking*, *walked* which would all be stemmed into *walk*. We can stem a text using, e.g., the  `stemDocument` function from the `tm` package.


```{r atp11, message=F, warning=F}
et_stem <-  tm::stemDocument(reviews_pos[4], language = "en")
# inspect
et_stem
```

**Tokenization, lemmatization, pos-tagging, and dependency parsing**

A far better option than stemming is lemmatization as lemmatization is based on proper morphological information and vocabularies. For lemmatization, we can use the `udpipe` package which also tokenizes texts, adds part-of-speech tags, and provides information about dependency relations. 

Before we can tokenize, lemmatize, pos-tag and parse though, we need to download a pre-trained language model.

```{r atp12, eval = F, message=F, warning=F}
# download language model
m_eng   <- udpipe::udpipe_download_model(language = "english-ewt")
```


If you have downloaded a model once, you can also load the model directly from the place where you stored it on your computer. In my case, I have stored the model in a folder called udpipemodels

```{r atp14, message=F, warning=F}
# load language model from your computer after you have downloaded it once
m_eng <- udpipe::udpipe_load_model(file = here::here("english-ewt-ud-2.5-191206.udpipe"))
```

We can now use the model to annotate out text.

```{r atp17, message=F, warning=F}
# tokenise, tag, dependency parsing
text_anndf <- udpipe::udpipe_annotate(m_eng, x = reviews_pos[4]) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  dplyr::select(-sentence)
# inspect
head(text_anndf, 10)
```

We could, of course, perform many more manipulations of textual data but this should suffice to get you started.

### Cleaning texts

When working with texts, we usually need to clean the data. Below, we do some very basic cleaning using a pipeline.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
reviews_pos_split_clean <- reviews_pos_split %>%
  # replace elements
  stringr::str_replace_all("<.*?>", " ") %>%
  # convert to lower case
  tolower() %>%
  # remove strange symbols
  stringr::str_replace_all("[^[:alnum:][:punct:]]+", " ") %>%
  # remove \"
  stringr::str_remove_all("\"") %>%
  # remove superfluous white spaces
  stringr::str_squish()
# remove very short elements
reviews_pos_split_clean <- reviews_pos_split_clean[nchar(reviews_pos_split_clean) > 10]
# inspect data
nchar(reviews_pos_split_clean)
```

Inspect text

```{r, eval = F, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
reviews_pos_split_clean[1]
```

### Concordancing and KWICs

Creating concordances or key-word-in-context displays is one of the most common practices when dealing with text data. Fortunately, there exist ready-made functions that make this a very easy task in R. We will use the `kwic` function from the `quanteda` package to create kwics here. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
kwic_multiple <- quanteda::kwic(reviews_pos_split_clean, 
       pattern = phrase("audience"),
       window = 3, 
       valuetype = "regex") %>%
  as.data.frame()
# inspect data
head(kwic_multiple)
```

We can now also select concordances based on specific features. For example, we only want those instances of "great again" if the preceding word was "America". 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
kwic_multiple_select <- kwic_multiple %>%
  # last element before search term is "the"
  dplyr::filter(str_detect(pre, "the$"))
# inspect data
head(kwic_multiple_select)
```

Again, we can use the `write.table` function to save our kwics to disc.

```{r, echo = T, eval = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
write.table(kwic_multiple_select, here::here("data", "kwic_multiple_select.txt"), sep = "\t")
```

As most of the data that we use is on out computers (rather than being somewhere on the web), we now load files with text from your computer. 




We now turn to data visualization basics.

## Working with graphics

There are numerous function in R that we can use to visualize data. We will use the `ggplot` function from the `ggplot2` package here to visualize the data. 

The `ggplot2` package was developed by Hadley Wickham in 2005 and it implements the graphics scheme described in the book *The Grammar of Graphics* by Leland Wilkinson.

The idea behind the  *Grammar of Graphics* can be boiled down to 5 bullet points (see Wickham 2016: 4):

- a statistical graphic is a mapping from data to **aes**thetic attributes (location, color, shape, size) of **geom**etric objects (points, lines, bars). 

- the geometric objects are drawn in a specific **coord**inate system.

- **scale**s control the mapping from data to aesthetics and provide tools to read the plot (i.e., axes and legends).

- the plot may also contain **stat**istical transformations of the data (means, medians, bins of data, trend lines).

- **facet**ing can be used to generate the same plot for different subsets of the data.


### Basics of ggplot2 syntax 

**Specify data, aesthetics and geometric shapes** 

`ggplot(data, aes(x=, y=, color=, shape=, size=)) +`   
`geom_point()`, or `geom_histogram()`, or `geom_boxplot()`, etc.   

- This combination is very effective for exploratory graphs. 

- The data must be a data frame.

- The `aes()` function maps columns of the data frame to aesthetic properties of geometric shapes to be plotted.

- `ggplot()` defines the plot; the `geoms` show the data; each component is added with `+` 

- Some examples should make this clear

### Practical examples  

We will now create some basic visualizations or plots.



Before we start plotting, we will load tabular data (information about the speakers in the dinner conversations) and the prepare the data that we want to visualize. In this case, we will extract the mean word counts by gender and age.

```{r, echo=T, eval=T, message=F, warning=F}
icebio <- readxl::read_excel(here::here("data", "ICEdata.xlsx")) %>%
  # only private dialogue
  dplyr::filter(stringr::str_detect(text.id, "S1A"),
                # without speaker younger than 19
                age != "0-18",
                age != "NA") %>%
  dplyr::group_by(sex, age) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(words = mean(word.count))
# inspect
head(icebio)
```


In the example below, we specify that we want to visualize the `plotdata` and that the x-axis should represent `Age` and the y-axis `Words`(the mean frequency of words). We also tell R that we want to group the data by `Sex` (i.e. that we want to distinguish between men and women). Then, we add `geom_line` which tells R that we want a line graph. The result of this is shown below. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(icebio, aes(x = age, y = words, group = sex, color = sex)) +
  geom_line()
```

Once you have a basic plot like the one above, you can prettify the plot. For example, you can 

+ change the width of the lines (`size = 1.25`)

+ change the y-axis limits (`coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 1000)) `)

+ use a different theme (`theme_bw()` means black and white theme)

+ move the legend to the top

+ change the default colors to colors you like (*scale_color_manual ...`)

+ change the linetype (`scale_linetype_manual ...`)

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
icebio %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = words, color = sex,  group = sex, linetype = sex)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.25) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 1500)) +
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(legend.position = "top") + 
  scale_color_manual(breaks = c("female", "male"),
                     values = c("gray20", "gray50")) +
  scale_linetype_manual(breaks = c("female", "male"),
                        values = c("solid", "dotted")) +
  labs(x = "Age groups", y = "Average word count\n(per 1,000 words)")
```


An additional and very handy feature of this way of producing graphs is that you 

+ can integrate them into pipes 

+ can easily combine plots.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
readxl::read_excel(here::here("data", "ICEdata.xlsx")) %>%
  dplyr::filter(sex != "NA",
                age != "NA",
                word.count > 10) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(age = factor(age),
                sex = factor(sex)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, 
             y = word.count,
             color = sex,
             linetype = sex)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = .5, width = .2) +
  stat_summary(fun=mean, geom="line", aes(group=sex)) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 2500)) +
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(legend.position = "top") + 
  scale_color_manual(breaks = c("female", "male"),
                     values = c("indianred", "darkblue")) +
  scale_linetype_manual(breaks = c("female", "male"),
                        values = c("solid", "dotted"))
```

You can also create different types of graphs very easily and split them into different facets.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
readxl::read_excel(here::here("data", "ICEdata.xlsx")) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  dplyr::filter(age != "NA",
                age != "0-18") %>%
  dplyr::mutate(date = factor(date)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, 
             y = word.count, 
             fill = sex)) +
  facet_grid(vars(date)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 2000)) +
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(legend.position = "top") + 
  scale_fill_manual(breaks = c("female", "male"),
                     values = c("#E69F00", "#56B4E9"))
```


Create a bar plot showing the number of men and women by `Date`.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
readxl::read_excel(here::here("data", "ICEdata.xlsx")) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  dplyr::filter(age != "NA",
                sex != "NA",
                date != "NA",
                age != "0-18") %>%
  dplyr::mutate(date = factor(date)) %>%
  dplyr::select(date, sex, text.id) %>%
  unique() %>%
  dplyr::group_by(date, sex) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(speakers = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = speakers, fill = date, label = speakers)) +
  facet_wrap(vars(sex), ncol = 2) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_text(vjust=-1.6, color = "black") +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 150)) +
  theme_bw() + 
  scale_fill_manual(breaks = c("1990-1994", "1995-2001", "2002-2005"),
                     values = c("#E69F00", "lightgray", "#56B4E9"))
```


## Working with tables

We will now start working with data in R. As most of the data that we work with comes in tables, we will focus on this first before moving on to working with text data.



### Loading data from the web

To show, how data can be downloaded from the web, we will download a tab-separated txt-file. Translated to prose, the code below means *Create an object called *icebio *and in that object, store the result of the `read.delim` function*. 

`read.delim` stands for *read delimited file* and it takes the URL from which to load the data (or the path to the data on your computer) as its first argument. The `sep` stand for separator and the `\t` stands for tab-separated and represents the second argument that the `read.delim` function takes. The third argument, `header`, can take either T(RUE) or F(ALSE) and it tells R if the data has column names (headers) or not. 


```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load data
icebio <- read.delim("https://slcladal.github.io/data/icebio.txt", 
                      sep = "\t", header = T)
```

### Inspecting data

There are many ways to inspect data. We will briefly go over the most common ways to inspect data.

The `head` function takes the data-object as its first argument and automatically shows the first 6 elements of an object (or rows if the data-object has a table format).

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
head(icebio)
```

We can also use the `head` function to inspect more or less elements and we can specify the number of elements (or rows) that we want to inspect as a second argument. In the example below, the `4` tells R that we only want to see the first 4 rows of the data.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
head(icebio, 4)
```

***

<div class="warning" style='padding:0.1em; background-color:#51247a; color:#f2f2f2'>
<span>
<p style='margin-top:1em; text-align:center'>
<b>EXERCISE TIME!</b></p>
<p style='margin-left:1em;'>
</p></span>
</div>

<div class="question">` 

1. Download and inspect the first 7 rows of the data set that you can find under this URL: `https://slcladal.github.io/data/lmmdata.txt`. Can you guess what the data is about?

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  ```{r loadtext}
  ex1data <- read.delim("https://slcladal.github.io/data/lmmdata.txt", sep = "\t")
  head(ex1data, 7)
  ```
  The data is about texts and the different columns provide information about the texts such as  when the texts were written (`Date`), the genre the texts represent (`Genre`), the name of the texts (`Text`), the relative frequencies of prepositions the texts contain (`Prepositions`), and the region where the author was from (`Region`).
</details>

</div>`

***



### Accessing individual cells in a table

If you want to access specific cells in a table, you can do so by typing the name of the object and then specify the rows and columns in square brackets (i.e. **data[row, column]**). For example, `icebio[2, 4]` would show the value of the cell in the second row and fourth column of the object `icebio`. We can also use the colon to define a range (as shown below, where 1:5 means from 1 to 5 and 1:3 means from 1 to 3) The command `icebio[1:5, 1:3]` thus means:

*Show me the first 5 rows and the first 3 columns of the data-object that is called icebio*. 
 
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
icebio[1:5, 1:3]
```

**Inspecting the structure of data**

You can use the `str` function to inspect the structure of a data set. This means that this function will show the number of observations (rows) and variables (columns) and tell you what type of variables the data consists of 

- **int** = integer
- **chr** = character string
- **num** = numeric
- **fct** = factor

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
str(icebio)
```

The `summary` function summarizes the data.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summary(icebio)
```

### Tabulating data

We can use the `table` function to create basic tables that extract raw frequency information. The following command tells us how many instances there are of each level of the variable `date` in the `icebio`.

</div>

<div class="question">` 

In order to access specific columns of a data frame, you can first type the name of the data set followed by a `$` symbol and then the name of the column (or variable).

</div>`

***


```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
table(icebio$date) 
```

Alternatively, you could, of course, index the column by using its position in the data set like this: `icebio[, 6]` - the result of `table(icebio[, 6])` and `table(icebio$date)` are the same! Also note that here we leave out indexes for rows to tell R that we want all rows.

When you want to cross-tabulate columns, it is often better to use the `ftable` function (`ftable` stands for *frequency table*). 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ftable(icebio$age, icebio$sex)
```

### Saving data to your computer

To save tabular data on your computer, you can use the `write.table`  function. This function requires the data that you want to save as its first argument, the location where you want to save the data as the second argument and the type of delimiter as the third argument. 

```{r savedisc, eval = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
write.table(icebio, here::here("data", "icebio.txt"), sep = "\t") 
```

**A word about paths**

In the code chunk above, the sequence `here::here("data", "icebio.txt")` is a handy way to define a path. A path is simply the location where a file is stored on your computer or on the internet (which typically is a server - which is just a fancy term for a computer - somewhere on the globe). The `here` function from the`here` package allows to simply state in which folder a certain file is and what file you are talking about. 

In this case, we want to access the file `icebio` (which is a `txt` file and thus has the appendix `.txt`) in the `data` folder. R will always start looking in the folder in which your project is stored. If you want to access a file that is stored somewhere else on your computer, you can also define the full path to the folder in which the file is. In my case, this would be `D:/Uni/UQ/SLC/LADAL/SLCLADAL.github.io/data`. However, as the `data` folder in in the folder where my Rproj file is, I only need to specify that the file is in the `data` folder within the folder in which my Rproj file is located.

**A word about package naming**

Another thing that is notable in the sequence `here::here("data", "icebio.txt")` is that I specified that the `here` function is part of the `here` package. This is what I meant by writing `here::here` which simply means use the `here` function from `here` package (`package::function`). This may appear to be somewhat redundant but it happens quite frequently, that different packages have functions that have the same names. In such cases, R will simply choose the function from the package that was loaded last. To prevent R from using the wrong function, it makes sense to specify the package AND the function (as I did in the sequence `here::here`). I only use functions without specify the package if the function is part of base R.

### Loading data from your computer

 To load tabular data from within your project folder (if it is in a tab-separated txt-file) you can also use the `read.delim` function. The only difference to loading from the web is that you use a path instead of a URL. If the txt-file is in the folder called *data* in your project folder, you would load the data as shown below. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
icebio <- read.delim(here::here("data", "icebio.txt"), sep = "\t", header = T)
```

However, you can always just use the full path (and you must do this is the data is not in your project folder).

***

<div class="warning" style='padding:0.1em; background-color:#51247a; color:#f2f2f2'>
<span>
<p style='margin-top:1em; text-align:center'>
<b>NOTE</b><br>You may have to change the path to the data!</p>
<p style='margin-left:1em;'>
</p></span>
</div>

***

```{r, echo=T, eval=T, message=F, warning=F}
icebio <- read.delim(here::here("data", "icebio.txt"), 
                      sep = "\t", header = T)
```

To if this has worked, we will use the `head` function to see first 6 rows of the data

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
head(icebio)
```

### Loading Excel data

To load Excel spreadsheets, you can use the `read_excel` function from the `readxl` package as shown below. However, it may be necessary to install and activate the `readxl` package first. 

```{r, echo=T, eval=T, message=F, warning=F}
icebio <- readxl::read_excel(here::here("data", "ICEdata.xlsx"))
```

We now briefly check column names to see if the loading of the data has worked.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
colnames(icebio)
```


### Renaming, Piping, and Filtering 

To rename existing columns in a table, you can use the `rename` command which takes the table as the first argument, the new name as the second argument, the an equal sign (=), and finally, the old name es the third argument. For example, renaming a column *OldName* as *NewName* in a table called *MyTable* would look like this: `rename(MyTable, NewName = OldName)`.  

Piping is done using the `%>%` sequence and it can be translated as **and then**. In the example below, we create a new object (icebio_edit) from the existing object (icebio) *and then* we rename the columns in the new object. When we use piping, we do not need to name the data we are using as this is provided by the previous step.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
icebio_edit <- icebio %>%
  dplyr::rename(Id = id,
         FileSpeakerId = file.speaker.id,
         File = colnames(icebio)[3],
         Speaker = colnames(icebio)[4])
# inspect data
icebio_edit[1:5, 1:6]
```

A very handy way to rename many columns simultaneously, you can use the `str_to_title` function which capitalizes first letter of a word. In the example below, we capitalize all first letters of the column names of our current data.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
colnames(icebio_edit) <- stringr::str_to_title(colnames(icebio_edit))
# inspect data
icebio_edit[1:5, 1:6]
```

To remove rows based on values in columns you can use the `filter` function.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
icebio_edit2 <- icebio_edit %>%
  dplyr::filter(Speaker != "?",
         Zone != is.na(Zone),
         Date == "2002-2005",
         Word.count > 5)
# inspect data
head(icebio_edit2)
```

To select specific columns you can use the `select` function.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
icebio_selection <- icebio_edit2 %>%
  dplyr::select(File, Speaker, Word.count)
# inspect data
head(icebio_selection)
```

You can also use the `select` function to remove specific columns.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
icebio_selection2 <- icebio_edit2 %>%
  dplyr::select(-Id, -File, -Speaker, -Date, -Zone, -Age)
# inspect data
head(icebio_selection2)
```

### Ordering data

To order data, for instance, in ascending order according to a specific column you can use the `arrange` function.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
icebio_ordered_asc <- icebio_selection2 %>%
  dplyr::arrange(Word.count)
# inspect data
head(icebio_ordered_asc)
```

To order data in descending order you can also use the `arrange` function and simply add a - before the column according to which you want to order the data.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
icebio_ordered_desc <- icebio_selection2 %>%
  dplyr::arrange(-Word.count)
# inspect data
head(icebio_ordered_desc)
```

The output shows that the female speaker in file S2A-005 with the speaker identity A has the highest word count with 2,355 words.

### Creating and changing variables

New columns are created, and existing columns can be changed, by using the `mutate` function. The `mutate` function takes two arguments (if the data does not have to be specified): the first argument is the (new) name of column that you want to create and the second is what you want to store in that column. The = tells R that the new column will contain the result of the second argument.

In the example below, we create a new column called *Texttype*. 

This new column should contain 

  + the value *PrivateDialoge* if *Filespeakerid* contains the sequence *S1A*, 
  
  + the value *PublicDialogue* if *Filespeakerid* contains the sequence *S1B*, 
  
  + the value *UnscriptedMonologue* if *Filespeakerid* contains the sequence *S2A*, 
  
  + the value *ScriptedMonologue* if *Filespeakerid* contains the sequence *S2B*, 
  
  + the value of *Filespeakerid* if *Filespeakerid* neither contains *S1A*, *S1B*, *S2A*, nor *S2B*.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
icebio_texttype <- icebio_selection2 %>%
  dplyr::mutate(Texttype = 
                  dplyr::case_when(stringr::str_detect(Filespeakerid ,"S1A") ~ "PrivateDialoge",
                                   stringr::str_detect(Filespeakerid ,"S1B") ~ "PublicDialogue",
                                   stringr::str_detect(Filespeakerid ,"S2A") ~ "UnscriptedMonologue",
                                   stringr::str_detect(Filespeakerid ,"S2B") ~ "ScriptedMonologue",
                                   TRUE ~ Filespeakerid))
# inspect data
head(icebio_texttype)
```

### If-statements

We should briefly talk about if-statements (or `case_when` in the present case). The `case_when` function is both very powerful and extremely helpful as it allows you to assign values based on a test. As such, `case_when`-statements can be read as:

*When/If X is the case, then do A and if X is not the case do B!* (When/If -> Then -> Else)

The nice thing about `ifelse` or `case_when`-statements is that they can be used in succession as we have done above. This can then be read as:

*If X is the case, then do A, if Y is the case, then do B, else do Z*

<div class="question">` 

1.Using the data called `icebio`, create a new data set called `ICE_Ire_AgeGroup` in which you create a column called `AgeGroup` where all speakers who are younger than 42 have the value *young* and all speakers aged 42 and over *old*. 

**Tip**: use if-statements to assign the *old* and *young* values.

<details>

                                            age == "0-18" ~ "young",
                                            age == "19-25" ~ "young",

                                            age == "34-41" ~ "young", 
                                            TRUE ~age))
  # inspect data
  head(ICE_Ire_AgeGroup); table(ICE_Ire_AgeGroup$AgeGroup)
  ```
</details>

### Summarizing data

Summarizing is really helpful and can be done using the `summarise` function.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
icebio_summary1 <- icebio_texttype %>%
  dplyr::summarise(Words = sum(Word.count))
# inspect data
head(icebio_summary1)
```

To get summaries of sub-groups or by variable level, we can use the `group_by` function and then use the `summarise` function.

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
icebio_summary2 <- icebio_texttype %>%
  dplyr::group_by(Texttype, Sex) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(Speakers = n(),
            Words = sum(Word.count))
# inspect data
head(icebio_summary2)
```

<div class="question">` 

1. Use the `icebio` and determine the number of words uttered by female speakers from Northern Ireland above an age of 50.

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  ```{r}
  words_fni50 <- icebio %>%
  dplyr::select(zone, sex, age, word.count) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(zone, sex, age) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(Words = sum(word.count)) %>%
  dplyr::filter(sex == "female",
         age == "50+",
         zone == "northern ireland")
  # inspect data
  words_fni50
  ```
</details>

2. Load the file *exercisedata.txt* and determine the mean scores of groups A and B.

**Tip**: to extract the mean, combine the `summary` function with the `mean` function. 

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  ```{r}
  exercisedata <- read.delim(here::here("data", "exercisedata.txt"), sep = "\t", header = T) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(Group) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(Mean = mean(Score))
  # inspect data
  exercisedata
  ```
</details>

### Gathering and spreading data

The `tidyr` package has two very useful functions for gathering and spreading data that can be sued to transform data to long and wide formats (you will see what this means below). The functions are called `gather` and `spread`.

We will use the data set called `icebio_summary2`, which we created above, to demonstrate how this works.

We will first check out the `spread`-function to create different columns for women and men that show how many of them are represented in the different text types. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
icebio_summary_wide <- icebio_summary2 %>%
  dplyr::select(-Words) %>%
  tidyr::spread(Sex, Speakers)
# inspect
icebio_summary_wide
```

The data is now in what is called a `wide`-format as values are distributed across columns.

To reformat this back to a `long`-format where each column represents exactly one variable, we use the `gather`-function:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
icebio_summary_long <- icebio_summary_wide %>%
  tidyr::gather(Sex, Speakers, female:male)
# inspect
icebio_summary_long
```

## Ending R sessions

At the end of each session, you can extract information about the session itself (e.g. which R version you used and which versions of packages). This can help others (or even your future self) to reproduce the analysis that you have done.

### Extracting session information

You can extract the session information by running the `sessionInfo` function (without any arguments)

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
